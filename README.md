# TRPO and its variants

Implementation of ["Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477) and variants having different constraints. Also implemented a version that estimate advantage values using neural net and optimize the objective directly.

The code is mostly ported from [original implementation by John Schulman](https://github.com/joschu/modular_rl).
